# Introduction to Matlab 1

Learning [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) is a valuable asset for enhancing research due to its specialised capabilities for data analysis, numerical simulation, and algorithm development. Proficiency in MATLAB equips researchers with a versatile skill set applicable across disciplines, fostering innovation and efficient problem-solving. Its industry relevance also opens doors to diverse career opportunities.

This course is designed by the [research-it team](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) at the University of Sheffield with the aim of introducing researchers with no or little programming background or those who want to refresh their skills to the framework called Matlab

## Prerequisites

No prior programming experience is assumed or required for this course. If you wish to do some reading to get familiar with the basics before the course the [Getting Started with Matlab](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html) guide by Mathworks (creators of Matlab) is a great starting place.

If you are attending an in-person taught version of this workshop please ensure you have the following:
- A laptop with matlab installed.
