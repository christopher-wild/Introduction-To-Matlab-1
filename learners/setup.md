title: Setup
---

This is a newly built lesson to introduce academics at the University of Sheffield to MATLAB. It is built using the [Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/)

## Data Sets

For this lesson you will require 2 datasets available from Google Drive:
[Sheffield Rain](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18t1hnEpIaTtEHigk4HLY92C98MOBaMKO/view?usp=drive_link)
[India Rain](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZtwwQorKcxIi1pkNSqkwbBiGHOPFeOQp/view?usp=drive_link)

You don't need to do anything but download them onto your computer before the lesson.

## Software Setup

It is preferable if you could bring your own machine with MATLAB downloaded onto it. Instructions on how to download MATLAB can be found here:
