## Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare the values in 2 arrays and returns a logical array.

Here are the most common logical operators in MATLAB:

``` MATLAB
data == 50 % Are any data points equal to 50?
data ~= 50 % Are any data points not equal to 50?
data > 50 % Are any data points greater than 50?
data < 50 % Are any data points less than 50?
data >= 50 % Are any data points greater than or equal to 50?
data <= 50 % Are any data points less than or equal to 50?

```

An example of one in use would be

``` MATLAB

a = [1 1 1 1];
b = [1 2 1 2];

a == b

ans =

  1Ã—4 logical array

   1   0   1   0
```
::: callout

## MATLAB Logic

MATLAB represents logical true and false statements with 1 and 0, where 1 is true and 0 is false

:::

The returned logical array tells us that the first values were equal, the second not equal, etc.
