## Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare the values in 2 arrays and returns a logical array.

Here are the most common logical operators in MATLAB:

``` MATLAB
data == 50 % Are any data points equal to 50?
data ~= 50 % Are any data points not equal to 50?
data > 50 % Are any data points greater than 50?
data < 50 % Are any data points less than 50?
data >= 50 % Are any data points greater than or equal to 50?
data <= 50 % Are any data points less than or equal to 50?

```

Here is an example of comparing two arrays:

``` MATLAB

a = [1 1 1 1];
b = [1 2 1 2];

a == b

```
``` OUTPUT
ans =

  1Ã—4 logical array

   1   0   1   0
```
::: callout

## MATLAB Logic

MATLAB represents logical true and false statements with 1 and 0, where 1 is true and 0 is false

:::

The returned logical array tells us that the first values were equal, the second not equal, etc.

## If Statements

If statements allow us to execute different lines of code depending on a logical value.


``` MATLAB
c = 10

if c > 0
  disp('c is positive')
end
```
``` OUTPUT
c is positive
```

In this example, `c > 0` is called the **condition**, `disp('c is positive')` is 
the code which will be executed if the condition is true, and every if statement 
in MATLAB should be terminated with an `end` 

We can use some inbuilt functions such as `any` or `all` to test a condition across an entire array.

For example, we have a data set representing student marks called data, where each value is a mark out of 100, each row a student and each column a subject:

``` MATLAB
student_marks = round(100*rand(4,6));
```
We could test if any there any marks below or equal to 10 with the following code

``` MATLAB


if any(student_marks < 10)
  disp('Severe failing mark in dataset')
end
```

::: challenge

Using the `student_marks` data above, display a sentence if any student achieves a first (70 or more) in the 3rd subject

::: solution

``` MATLAB

if any(student_marks(:,3) >= 70)
  disp('At least 1 student has achieved a first in subject 3')
end
```
:::
:::

### if else elseif

Conditions can be chained together using the `else` and `elseif` terms. This allows for multiple different code blocks to be used depending on multiple conditions.

``` MATLAB
if all(student_marks(:,2) >= 70)
  disp('All students have a first in subject 2')
elseif any(student_marks(:,2) >= 70)
  disp('At least 1 student has a first in subject 2')
else
  disp('No students have a first in subject 2')
end
```

## Loops

Loops in coding allow for blocks of code to be executed multiple times depending on some logic. 
This can save you from having redundant copy and pasted code, making your code shorter and easier to read.

There are two main loop types in MATLAB, for loops and while loops. 
A for loop repeats a specified number of times, a while loop repeats until a logical condition is met.


### For Loops

For loops have the following syntax

```
for index = values
  code
end
```

`values` is typically a vector where the length will define the number of repetitions

`index` will be the current value of values for this iteration. In the exaple below,

``` MATLAB
A = 1:5;
for ii in A
  disp(ii)
```

``` OUTPUT
1
2
3
4
5
```

In this example our `values` is `1:5` which if you remember from indexing produces a vector `[1 2 3 4 5]`

So our for loop, loops 5 times, the first loop our index `ii` will be 1, then 2, etc.

::: challenge

Create a for loop that sums the even numbers in the range 0 to 20. 

::: hint
Try creating another variable called total equal to 0, for each iteration of the loop add the current index

Also think back to previous episodes where we covered indexes and counting in steps
:::

::: solution

``` MATLAB
total = 0
for ii 0:2:20
  total = total + ii
end
```
