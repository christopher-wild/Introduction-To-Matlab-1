- Understand if and else statements to create conditional code
- Learn some new tools and functions relating to logic

## Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare the values in 2 arrays and returns a logical array.

Here are the most common logical operators in MATLAB:

``` MATLAB
data == 50 % Are any data points equal to 50?
data ~= 50 % Are any data points not equal to 50?
data > 50 % Are any data points greater than 50?
data < 50 % Are any data points less than 50?
data >= 50 % Are any data points greater than or equal to 50?
data <= 50 % Are any data points less than or equal to 50?

```

Here is an example of comparing two arrays:

``` MATLAB

a = [1 1 1 1];
b = [1 2 1 2];

a == b

```
``` OUTPUT
ans =

  1Ã—4 logical array

   1   0   1   0
```
::: callout

## MATLAB Logic

MATLAB represents logical true and false statements with 1 and 0, where 1 is true and 0 is false

:::

The returned logical array tells us that the first values were equal, the second not equal, etc.

## If Statements

If statements allow us to execute different lines of code depending on a logical value.


``` MATLAB
c = 10

if c > 0
  disp('c is positive')
end
```
``` OUTPUT
c is positive
```

In this example, `c > 0` is called the **condition**, `disp('c is positive')` is 
the code which will be executed if the condition is true, and every if statement 
in MATLAB should be terminated with an `end` 

We can use some inbuilt functions such as `any` or `all` to test a condition across an entire array.

For example, we have a data set representing student marks called data, where each value is a mark out of 100, each row a student and each column a subject:

``` MATLAB
student_marks = round(100*rand(4,6));
```
We could test if any there any marks below or equal to 10 with the following code

``` MATLAB


if any(student_marks < 10)
  disp('Severe failing mark in dataset')
end
```

::: challenge

Using the `student_marks` data above, display a sentence if any student achieves a first (70 or more) in the 3rd subject

::: solution

``` MATLAB

if any(student_marks(:,3) >= 70)
  disp('At least 1 student has achieved a first in subject 3')
end
```
:::
:::

### if else elseif

Conditions can be chained together using the `else` and `elseif` terms. This allows for multiple different code blocks to be used depending on multiple conditions.

``` MATLAB
if all(student_marks(:,2) >= 70)
  disp('All students have a first in subject 2')
elseif any(student_marks(:,2) >= 70)
  disp('At least 1 student has a first in subject 2')
else
  disp('No students have a first in subject 2')
end
```

## Logical Indexing

In the working with variables chapter, we looked at how we can index a variable with row and column numbers.

``` MATLAB
data = [1 3 5 7; 2 4 6 8];
data(2,4)
```
``` OUTPUT
8
```

Here we will look at indexing using logic arrays, which going back are the result of relational operators.


``` MATLAB
big_data = data >= 4 

data(big_data)
```
``` OUTPUT
ans =

     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
```
First we create a logical array called `big_data`, which is the result of us looking for numbers in our data greater than or equal to 4.

We can then use this to index data, like slicing by index number, the result being only the part of data that is bigger than 4.

These two lines can be combined as well, avoiding the need to save the logical array as it's own variable

``` MATLAB
data(data >= 4)
```
``` OUTPUT
ans =

     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
```

### logical not

A useful tool when handling logical arrays is the logical not, represented with the `~` symbol.

This operation inverts a logical array, which can be used to find values that don't meet a condition. 

``` MATLAB

big_data = data >= 4;
disp(big_data)
disp(~big_data)
```

``` OUTPUT
   0   0   1   1
   0   1   1   1

   1   1   0   0
   1   0   0   0
```

### isnan

The final the we will look at in this episode is the `isnan` function. This function returns a logical array containing true (1) where there is a NaN in the array.

This could be used to replace the NaN values with a default value like 0, or combined with the logical not to only select non-nan data:

``` MATLAB
data = [2 4 NaN 8; 1 NaN 5 7];

data = data(~isnan(data))
```

``` OUTPUT
data =

     2
     1
     4
     5
     8
     7
```
